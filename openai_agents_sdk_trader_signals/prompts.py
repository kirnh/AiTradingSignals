                        company being analyzed.
                        
                        🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT #1 - PROCESS ALL ENTITIES: You MUST process EVERY SINGLE entity 
                        in the input. Count the entities in the input and ensure your output contains the EXACT 
                        SAME NUMBER of entities. If the input has 2 entities, your output MUST have 2 entities.

                        EVERY SINGLE news article. If an entity has 10 articles in the input, your output MUST 
                        have 10 articles for that entity. DO NOT skip any articles.
                        
                        🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT #3 - MULTIPLE TOKENS PER ARTICLE: You MUST extract EXACTLY 5 sentiment tokens

                        than 5 tokens, the output will be INVALID and the system will fail.

                        WORKFLOW (FOLLOW EXACTLY - DO NOT SKIP ANY STEP):

                              i. MANDATORY: Use fetch_article_content(url) to get the FULL article text - DO NOT skip this step
                              ii. Read and analyze the ENTIRE article content carefully - look for multiple signals
                              iii. Identify EXACTLY 5 distinct sentiment signals in the article:
                                  - Key events or announcements (e.g., "Company X launches new product")
                                  - Financial implications (e.g., "Revenue increase of 20%")

                              iv. Extract EXACTLY 5 distinct sentiment tokens - each representing a DIFFERENT aspect
                              v. Add ALL 5 sentiment_tokens to THIS article (MANDATORY: exactly 5)
                        4. VERIFY your output:
                           - Same number of entities as input
                           - For each entity, same number of articles as input
                           - Each article has exactly 5 sentiment_tokens
                        5. Return ALL entities with ALL news articles, each article containing EXACTLY 5 sentiment_tokens
                        
                        ⚠️ MANDATORY RULES (SYSTEM WILL FAIL IF NOT FOLLOWED):

                        - Extract EXACTLY 5 sentiment tokens per article (MINIMUM 5, MAXIMUM 5)
                        - Each token MUST represent a DIFFERENT aspect, event, or signal from the article

                        - Sentiment tokens MUST be extracted from the specific article they belong to
                        - Do NOT aggregate tokens at the entity level - tokens belong to individual articles
                        - If an article seems to have limited signals, dig deeper and find 5 different angles:
                          * Direct impact on main company
                          * Indirect market effects
                          * Competitive positioning
                          * Supply chain implications
                          * Financial consequences
                          * Technology implications
                          * Regulatory effects
                        - Preserve all article fields: url, title, source, published_date

                        For each sentiment token, provide:
                        - token_text (or tokenText): A specific, distinct key phrase or event from the news article
                        - impact: 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' (how it affects the main company)

                        ⚠️ MANDATORY RULES (SYSTEM WILL FAIL IF NOT FOLLOWED):
                        - Extract EXACTLY 5 sentiment tokens (MINIMUM 5, MAXIMUM 5)
                        - Each token MUST represent a DIFFERENT aspect, event, or signal from the article
                        - You MUST use fetch_article_content() to read the full article - do not analyze just the title
                        - If an article seems to have limited signals, dig deeper and find 5 different angles:
                          * Direct impact on main company
                          * Indirect market effects
                          * Competitive positioning
                          * Supply chain implications
                          * Financial consequences
                          * Technology implications
                          * Regulatory effects
                        - Preserve all article fields: url, title, source, published_date
                        - Preserve all entity fields: entity_name, relationship_strength, relationship_type
                        
                        For each sentiment token, provide:
                        - token_text (or tokenText): A specific, distinct key phrase or event from the news article
                        - impact: 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' (how it affects the main company)
                        - direction: 'bullish', 'bearish', or 'neutral' (trading signal)
                        - strength: 0.0 to 1.0 (confidence in the signal)
